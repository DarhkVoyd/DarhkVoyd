# 🧩 jigsaw

> “aligning pieces...”

### 🌐 Overview

- The world of `jigsaw` is a **3D interactive home** where all pieces of my life — code, writing, thoughts, memories, and quests — fit together like a puzzle that can also be viewed as a classic webpage.

- Over time, I’ll keep adding and aligning pieces — major quests, small fragments, milestones, ideas — until the full image forms.

> “The jigsaw isn’t meant to be finished.
> It’s meant to be _lived in_.”

### 🧭 Roadmap (Conceptual)

- [ ] Define all interactive objects & their purposes
- [ ] Implement 3D “home room” in React Three Fiber
- [ ] Build classic webpage layouts

### 🌌 Two Viewing Modes

#### 1. **Interactive Mode (3D World / Room)**

A 3D world you can explore — my digital home:

- Contains interactable props:
  - **Desk / Terminal** → projects & commands (the dev interface)
  - **Bookshelf** → notes, books etc.
  - **Quest Board** → milestones & life goals & achievements
  - **Projector** → replays core memories / highlight of memories
  - **Cassette Shelf** → memory albums (click to replay)
  - **Jigsaw Wall** → the evolving mural of life’s image
  - **PhotoFrame Wall** → favorite moments, rest stay in the albums

#### 2. **Classic Mode (Web View)**

A minimal, fast, accessible website for readers and recruiters —
same data, simpler rendering.

- Clean, readable web layout of the same data.
- For visitors who prefer browsing rather than exploring the 3D world.
- Mirrors the same sections & data structure for consistency.
