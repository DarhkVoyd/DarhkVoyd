A self-learning developer, content creator with a growing collection of skillset and has always been keen in exploring and learning.
Currently, immersed into learning and implementing various development/programming techniques and workflows. Moreover, understanding to work in a community and starting to contribute more and more toward open-source projects and planning more projects to develop.
As a content creator, the raw experience of capturing the world though the lens of my perspective fills me with joy.  

The progress made with consistent tireless hard work in a short span of time drives my desire to grow further.
